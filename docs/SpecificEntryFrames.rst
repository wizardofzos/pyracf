Methods to select specific entries
==================================

In addition to the data table properties, data selection methods are
available to retrieve one profile, or profiles from one class, with an
easy syntax. The parameter(s) to these methods are used as a literal
search argument, and return entries that fully match the argument(s), that means, the selection criteria have to be match the profile exactly.
